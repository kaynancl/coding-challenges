# Count Elements Greater Than Previous Average

## Problem Description

Given an array of positive integers, return the number of elements that are **strictly greater** than the **average of all previous elements**.
Skip the first element when making comparisons.

---

## Example

### Input

responseTimes = [100, 200, 150, 300]

### Output

2

### Explanation

* **Day 0:** 100 → no previous days, skip
* **Day 1:** 200 > average(100) = 100 → count = 1
* **Day 2:** 150 vs average(100, 200) = 150 → not greater → count = 1
* **Day 3:** 300 > average(100, 200, 150) = 150 → count = 2

**Return:** 2

---

## Input Format

* The first line contains an integer `n` (0 ≤ n ≤ 1000), the number of days.
* If `n > 0`, the next `n` lines each contain an integer representing `responseTimes[i]`.
* If `n = 0`, the second line is omitted or empty.

### Example

4
100
200
150
300

Here `4` is the length of the array, followed by the elements on each line.

---

## Constraints

* 0 <= responseTimes.length <= 1000
* 1 <= responseTimes[i] <= 10^9 for 0 <= i < responseTimes.length

---

## Output Format

A single integer depicting the count of elements (days) that are greater than the average of all previous elements.
